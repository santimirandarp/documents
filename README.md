# Documents

On this repo I store part of the things I've been learning over 2019/2020. I normally write markdown, and a tiny bash script compiles the files to html. And then add a couple of lines manually.

The topics are linux and web development.

You can access the website through [this link](https://santimirandarp.github.io/documents/).

Docs may be wrong or incomplete, feel free to push changes and raise issues.
