# Documents

[Access the Website](https://santimirandarp.github.io/documents/pages).

On this repo I store part of the things I've been learning over 2019/2020. I normally write markdown, and a tiny bash script compiles the files to html. And then add a couple of lines manually.

The topics are linux, web development, networking.
