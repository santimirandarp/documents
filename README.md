# Documents

[Access the Website](https://santimirandarp.github.io/documents/pages).

On this repo I store part of the things I've been learning over 2019/2020. I normally write markdown, and a tiny bash script compiles the files to html. And then add a couple of lines manually.

The topics are linux and web development.


## Workflow
I started this repo writing html documents, but it's way easier to write markdown. 

Markdown is enough for most of this simple documents. The .md files are compiled to html, and then manually add an entry for index.css and index.js

1. If you want to edit or create a file, do it as a markdown file, on md/ folder.

2. If you want to edit a file that **is not** on md/ edit the html file.

I won't write many more documents, but instead will focus on make the workflow easier.
