# documents

On this repo I store part of the things I've been learning the last couple of months. Out of the raw stuff in text files (not in the repo) I made html files and a simple scss styling file that all these websites share. 

The stuff is mostly web-related stuff and linux. Probably will add latex and mathematics at some point (not in the near future).

You can access the website through (https://santimirandarp.github.io/documents/)[this link].
