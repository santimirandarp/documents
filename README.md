# documents

On this repo I store part of the things I've been learning the last year. I normally write markdown, and a tiny bash script compiles the files to html. Another script will add a line in the header to the stylesheet (this is not done yet).

The topics are mostly web dev, networks and linux. 

You can access the website through [this link](https://santimirandarp.github.io/documents/).

Beware that many things might break, as this is under constant changes till I find what I like.
