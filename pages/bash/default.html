<h1 id="how-is-the-default-software-set">How is the default software set?</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s say we double click on a file. It could be an image, or a text file. How does linux decide which one?</p>
<p>First of all, there are probably many defaults that the distro specifies. But apart from that we can change those in many ways. I know of at least 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>using xdg-mime</li>
<li>editing mimeapps.list, under the [Default Applications] settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are equivalent. In 1. we use a program to update <strong>mimeapps.list</strong>, in 2. we do it manually. </p>
<h2 id="using-xdg-mime-or-equivalent">Using xdg-mime (or equivalent)</h2>
<p>This is an example of how to set up inkscape to open png images:</p>
<pre><code>xdg-mime default inkscape.desktop image/png</code></pre>
<p>Where inkscape.desktop is the program desktop entry, and image/png is the mimetype of a file. </p>
<p>Most programs don&#39;t really use the extension to determine what a file&#39;s contents are, but the MIME, media type or mimetype. For a text file it would be text/plain. Again we can determine this using <code>xdg-mime query mimetype FILE</code></p>
<h2 id="how-and-what-are-those-appdesktop-files">How and what are those app.desktop files?</h2>
<p>Those are called desktop entries, and again, it&#39;s what opens up when we double click on a file, given that they are the default application for that MIME type. What really runs is <code>xdg-open</code>, which is a program we can also run from terminal.</p>
<p>The desktop entries are created when we install a program. But what if it&#39;s not? And anyways what are they?</p>
<p>(more stuff coming...)</p>
<h3 id="other-setter-programs">Other &quot;Setter&quot; Programs</h3>
<p>XDG is not the only program used for setting this type of task. There is exo, gnome, kde and many others depending on your distribution.</p>
<h2 id="go-gui">Go GUI</h2>
<p>Many times there is a GUI interface where we can just click &#39;default application&#39; for example &#39;default browser&#39; and we will get the same result.</p>
<p>For help type <code>man xdg-mime</code> on the terminal.</p>
