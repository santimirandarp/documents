<h1 id="bash">Bash</h1>
<p>From the user point of view a programming language consist on a script plus an interpreter. The interpreter that plays the script is either python, node, bash, etc. depending on the language we write the script. Bash then, is a scripting language and an interpreter. We use it to interact with the system.  To see which terminal we have run: echo $0. Normally, we should get <code>/bin/bash</code>.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s sometimes confusing that we can use bash to easy-run system binaries while other languages are not so common for those tasks. However, this can be achieved with any language. There are python terminals, or you can open a python interpreter on the terminal.  Linux terminal runs, by default, a bash interpreter.</p>
<p>If we type <code>cd ourdir</code> on the terminal, this is interpreted by bash when we press enter. We can think of the terminal as a &#39;file&#39; where we write the code.</p>
<p>We can run bash <em>the normal way</em> too. Just write a bash script and run <code>bash filename.sh</code> on the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="run-a-script">Run a script</h2>
<p>We could write the following code in <code>example.sh</code> file: </p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash 
echo &quot;Hello World&quot; </code></pre>
<p>Execute it by issuing <code>bash example.sh</code>.  You&#39;ll find the very first line in most languages. It tells the computer which interpreter to use.  For python:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python 
print(&quot;Hello World&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>And run <code>python example.py</code>. </p>
<p>You&#39;ll see people running <code>./scriptname</code> instead. That&#39;s how an executable is run. If we list the files <code>ls -l</code> we see there are no execution permissions, so the program won&#39;t run. We need to modify file permissions to be executable. </p>
<p>Run <code>sudo chmod +x filename</code>, to make &#39;filename&#39; executable.</p>
<h2 id="path-variable">PATH variable</h2>
<p>Most custom scripts should be under <code>~/bin</code> or <code>~/.local/bin</code>. Then we can add this dir to <em>$PATH</em> if it&#39;s not already there. Now we can run it as <code>scriptname</code> (needs to be an executable). </p>
