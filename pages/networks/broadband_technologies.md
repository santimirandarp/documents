# Broadband Technologies

Both DSL and Cable the infrastructure is already there. In contrast, Optic Fibre requires loads of money to build structure and throw the fiber cable lines.

* T1 (probably old now)
* Carrier Ethernet
* Point to Point (wireless). An antenna at home connects to a main antenna. 
* Wireless to Wireless. For PtP the antennas must be very well aligned, so we can not change the spot. For WtW this is not necessary.
We can buy those modems and a service for our computer, even for a cartr, etc.
* DSL (not shared), it's a phone line connected to the modem. The modem might or not be included on the router. Not as fast as Cable. There is Symmetric SDSL and assymetric (ADSL). Normally users have ADSL where upload/download speed ratio is less than 0.5, SDLS is same speed.
*  Cable (shared). Got better with time. On pick hours it slows down. It plugs the normal Cable (coaxial) on the modem; the ISP is the same company than the cable.
* FIOS fiber optic (great), it's the fastest and is not affected by interfecence as copper electric waves are.
* Satellite (huge latency, speed is ok). Not useful for RTC, Streamings, etc.

## Ethernet?
As far as I understand, all broadband technologies use Ethernet Standards, different from 802.3 which is for LAN.
