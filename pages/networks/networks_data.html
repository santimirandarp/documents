    <h1>Internet(works)</h1>
    <p>We talked about some ways, namely protocols, in which two computers - in a network -  can exchange data. But...
    <ul>
      <li>Are there types of networks?</li>
      <li>What are the components of a network?</li>
      <li>What's a simple example of a network?</li>
      <li>In short: What are networks?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Network</h2>
    <p>Although boring, knowing the types of network simplifies things. We can classify networks depending on the area they span, and whether they are wired or wireless.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>PAN, Personal Area Network. Devices in a PAN can be connected wireless via bluetooth, IR, NFS; or they can connect by cable.</li>
    <li>
    Local Area Network or LAN, frequent on an office, or a house. Devices connect either to a Switch by Ethernet Cable or to a Router by a Wifi card. LAN is wired-only;  WLAN is wireless instead. The Router connects to the Switch and this creates a closed network between wired and wireless devices.</li>
    <p>Nowadays, the Router may include the switch. Same thing goes for CAN (campus area network, usually being wireless).</p>
    <p>MAN, WAN. Metropolitan or Worldwide Area network. These days the connection is mostly by fiber cables. The Internet, or World Wide Web is a WAN. Devices in this network are connected using fiber cables. We reach the WAN from the LAN if the Modem is connected to the WAN.</p>
    <p>We can run nice LANs without any connection to the WAN.</p>

    <h2>WLAN</h2>
    <p>Router means 'the one who draws the route'. This route is the path to a set of devices. Components: An antenna/boost, Modem, Router, Ethernet Switches. WAN or internet port where the Modem connects.</p>
    <h3>Router</h3>
    <p> WLAN requires login/authentication. Either the Wifi Router or the Switch assigns each device an IP. This is called DHCP. To transfer data the router needs port and ip address of the other computer/device. The port is specific of the application, 8080 for webs, 3636 for windows remote desktop (WRD) etc etc. 
    <!--The router also controls which IPs and Applications are connecting by allowing/disabling ports and IPs (in the router config page). This is the way we can block facebook, youtube, and any other IP address.-->
    </p>
    <p>Allows to create different networks</p>

    <h3>Modem</h3>
    <p>Modem, Router and Switch may be compressed into one object. They still have very different role.</p>
    <p>The modem is usually connected to a Fiber Cable or to a Satellite on one end. On the other end it connects to the Router or Switch.</p>
    <p>The word modem comes from modulate/demodulate. It converts the signal from computer-friendly to antenna friendly and viceversa. The modem connects to the ISP (internet service provider). The connection to the ISP might be Fiber or Cable. 
    </p>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>In large areas we want to extend the Router wifi-range, using WAP or Booster/wifi extender. WAP and Booster do not have switches, <!--allowing ethernet (internet cable connection) for devices,--> do not assign IPs to devices in the network (the Router does) an do not have a WAN port. So these connect to the router, using ethernet cables (like phone cables, 8 lines on the plug instead).</p>
    <h3>Firewall</h3>
    <p>A firewall config may not be necessary because this is done in the router.</p>
    <p>A firewall stops the fire, in this case, dangerous data. <b>Host-based</b> firewalls are the ones set up on a computer, and protect only that computer. Windows comes with firewall and also 3rd parties can be installed. Antivirus might come with firewall. <b>Network-based</b> firewall rules are applied to the entire network. This is probably set in the switch or Router, by tweaking its config using the PC.</p>
