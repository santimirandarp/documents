    <h1>Internet(works)</h1>
    <p>We talked about some ways, namely protocols, in which two computers - in a network -  can exchange data. But...
    <ul>
      <li>Are there types of networks?</li>
      <li>What are the components of a network?</li>
      <li>What's a simple example of a network?</li>
      <li>In short: What are networks?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Network</h2>
    <p>Although boring, knowing the types of network simplifies things. We can classify networks depending on the area they span, and whether they are wired or wireless.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>pan. Devices in a PAN can be connected wireless via bluetooth, ir, nfs; or they can connect by cable.</li>
    <li>lan. Frequent on an office, or a house. Devices connect either to a Switch by Ethernet Cable or to a Router by a Wifi card. lan is wired-only;  wlan is wireless instead. The Router connects to the Switch and this creates a closed network between wired and wireless devices.</li>
    <p>Nowadays, the Router may include the switch. Same thing goes for can (campus area network, usually being wireless).</p>
    <p>man, wan. Metropolitan or Worldwide Area network. These days the connection is mostly by fiber cables. The Internet, or World Wide Web is a wan. Devices in this network are connected using fiber cables. We reach the wan from the lan if the Modem is connected to the wan.</p>
    <p>We can run nice lans without any connection to the wan.</p>

    <h2>Hardware on a Network</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modem: for DSL, Satellite, Cable, Fiber. Connects (data) our network with the external world (internet).</li>
      <li>Router: <em>the one who draws the route</em>. This route is the path the data follows, from a device to a device. It connects different networks.</li>
      <li>Firewall</li>
      <li>Switch: connects cabled devices to a network. There are unmanaged and managed switches. The latter ones can be programmed for specific tasks. The switch supports particular speeds.</li>
      <li>Wireless Access Point or  WAP (optional): connects wifi devices to a network. It's linked to the switch.</li>
      <li>Computer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modem</h3>
    <p>The modem is usually connected to a Fiber Cable or to a Satellite on one end. On the other end it connects to the Router or Switch.</p>
    <p>The word modem comes from modulate/demodulate. It converts the signal from computer-friendly to antenna friendly and viceversa. The modem connects to the ISP (internet service provider). The connection to the ISP might be Fiber or Cable. 
    </p>
    <h3>WAP speed</h3>
    <p>Wireless network devices (prefix=802.11). Examples: prefix-a, b, g, n. Most of them are compatible to each other (only a is useless), so buying any network card should work. We should pick up the best speed match though. n cover a good area and are quick.</p>
    <h3>Firewall</h3>
    <p>A firewall config may not be necessary because this is done in the router.</p>
    <p>A firewall stops the fire, in this case, dangerous data. <b>Host-based</b> firewalls are the ones set up on a computer, and protect only that computer. Windows comes with firewall and also 3rd parties can be installed. Antivirus might come with firewall. <b>Network-based</b> firewall rules are applied to the entire network. This is probably set in the switch or Router, by tweaking its config using the PC.</p>
    <h3>Cabling</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Small Office, Home Office</h2>
<p>soho networks are small networks; like a lan at home. For this kind of networks we can buy a particular type of Routers. Enterprise routers only route traffic from the wan, to the lan. soho routers can include many devices apart from the router. Usually a Switch (those phone plugs on the back), a DNS server, DHCP server, Firewall server, and Port forwarding.</p>
<p>We can configure a soho Router using a web browser, by typing the router's IP in the URL bar. This is not the way to set up an enterprise router.</p>
