    <h1>Internet(works)</h1>
    <p>We talked about some ways, namely protocols, in which two computers - in a network -  can interchange data. But...
    <ul>
      <li>Are there types of networks?</li>
      <li>What are the components of a network?</li>
      <li>What's a simple example of a network?</li>
      <li>In short: What are networks?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Network</h2>
    <p>Although boring, knowing the types of network makes a lot of sense. We can classify networks depending on the area they span, and whether they are wired or wireless.</p>
    <p>The smallest one is PAN, personal area network. Devices in a PAN can be connected wireless by bluetooth, IR, NFS, or even by cable.</p>
    <p>
    Next is Local Area Network or LAN. This is the network on an office, or a house. LAN uses switches where the devices connect using Ethernet cables. WLAN is wireless instead, and devices need a wifi card, and connect to the Router instead. Nowadays, the Router may contain a switch, and the LAN is composed by wired devices and wireless devices. Same thing goes for CAN (campus area network, usually being wireless).</p>
    <p>MAN, WAN. And this is Metropolitan or WorldWide area network. These days the connection is mostly by fiber cables. The Internet, or World Wide Web is a WAN. And the devices are connected using fiber cables. In turn, those devices are, for example, routers, delivering data to another device inside a WLAN, etc.</p>

    <h2>WLAN</h2>
    <p>In a network, we can think of data as an old fashion mail post. The router is the carrier. The address is given by the sender, using IP and PORT of the target computer.</p> 
    <p>Router means 'the one who draws the route'. This route is the path to the device. Components: An antenna/boost, Ethernet Switches and a WAN or internet port where the Modem connects.</p>
    <p>Now, we know that without the wan port (that strange cable coming from the outside), we could still have a Local Area Network, and even a WLAN. The outside-cable comes from an antenna.</p>
    <p>We've said that devices connected to the same wifi-router or ethernet switch are in a Local Area Network (LAN).</p>
    <h3>How does the Router, Route?</h3>
    <p> WLAN requires login. Either the Wifi Router or the Switch assigns each device an IP (once they are connected). This is called DHCP. To transfer data the router needs port and ip address of the other computer/device. The port is specific of the application, 8080 for webs, 3636 for windows remote desktop (WRD) etc etc. 
    <!--The router also controls which IPs and Applications are connecting by allowing/disabling ports and IPs (in the router config page). This is the way we can block facebook, youtube, and any other IP address.-->
    </p>

    <h2>Modem</h2>
    <p>A Router needs a Modem. It links Antenna and Router. The word modem comes from modulate/demodulate (of an electric wave). It converts the signal from computer-friendly to antenna friendly and viceversa. A Modem and a Router might be integrated in one unit.  The modems connect straight to the ISP (internet service provider). The connection to the ISP might be Fiber or Cable. They have similitudes and differences to check before set up one ISP. 
    </p>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>A typical connection might be depicted PC&mdash;router&mdash;modem&mdash;antennas. In large areas (like a campsite) we may want to extend the Router wifi-range. For this we can use another router, wap, or booster/wifi extender.</p>
    <p>WAP and booster do not have switches, and <!--allowing ethernet (internet cable connection) for devices,--> they do not assign IPs to devices in the network (the router does).</p>
    <p>A firewall config is not necessary because again this is done in the router.</p>
    <p>WAPs do not have a WAN port. These do need wired connection to the router. Wifi extenders or boosters instead do not need a cable connection to the router. WAPs connect to the router using ethernet cables (similar to phone cables, 8 lines on the plug instead). 
    <h4>Firewall</h4>
    <p>A firewall stops the fire, in this case, dangerous data. <b>Host-based</b> firewalls are the ones set up on a computer, and protect only that computer. Windows comes with firewall and also 3rd parties can be installed. Antivirus might come with firewall. <b>Network-based</b> firewall rules are applied to the entire network. This is probably set in the switch or Router, by tweaking its config using the PC.</p>
