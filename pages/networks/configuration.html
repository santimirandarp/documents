<h1 id="configurational-aspects-of-networks">Configurational aspects of networks</h1>
<ul>
<li>IP address: identifies a device on a network.</li>
<li>Subnet Mask: logical segment of a network, so, for example, they do not share resources like public folders.</li>
<li>Default Gateway: Router. If a resource is not found inside the LAN, goes through the Gateway to the WAN.</li>
<li>dns server: maps domain names to IPs.</li>
<li>dhcp: dynamic host control protocol. This server assigns the previous network parameters to a device that connects to a network. dhcp server has to be configured.</li>
<li>Static: we can set this manually, but it&#39;s prone to errors (2 devices could be the same IP).</li>
<li>nat: network address translation. IP needs to be unique on a LAN, but when a message goes off the network, it keeps two pieces of data: 1. the gateway IP, 2. the computer IP.</li>
</ul>
<p>PCs on different LANs can be the same ip. If they are same IP on the same LAN, then this will cause data losses.</p>
<h2 id="network-parameters">Network Parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li>inet 192.168.1.25  IP address of a computer in a network</li>
<li>broadcast 192.168.1.255 is an internal ip but is it Router ip?</li>
<li>[sub]netmask 255.255.255.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>More on Subnet Mask</h2>
<p>
255.255.255.0 helps us to read IPs addresses and understand them. Helps us to identify the subnetwork, and the devices on it. 
</p>
<p>
Devices under 192.168.1.X are on the same subnetwork. 
  For example, 192.168.1.25 and 192.168.1.255 are on the same subnetwork. 192.168.2.X is meaningless here (because no devices will be assigned that ip). But were the subnet mask 255.255.X.Y then it would be meaningful.
</p>
<p>The left side from the 0 indicates the network part of the IP, and the right side are numbers left for devices.</p>
<p> Classify subnet according to that subnetmask ip. A: 255.0.0.0, B:255.255.0.0, C:255.255.255.0</p>
