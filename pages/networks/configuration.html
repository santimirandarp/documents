<h1 id="configurational-aspects-of-networks">Configurational aspects of networks</h1>
<ul>
<li>IP address: identifies a device on a network.</li>
<li>Subnet Mask: logical segment of a network, so, for example, they do not share resources like public folders.</li>
<li>Default Gateway: Router. If a resource is not found inside the LAN, goes through the Gateway to the WAN.</li>
<li>dns server: maps domain names to IPs.</li>
<li>dhcp: dynamic host control protocol. This server assigns the previous network parameters to a device that connects to a network. dhcp server has to be configured.</li>
<li>Static: we can set this manually, but it&#39;s prone to errors (2 devices could be the same IP).</li>
<li>nat: network address translation. IP needs to be unique on a LAN, but when a message goes off the network, it keeps two pieces of data: 1. the gateway IP, 2. the computer IP.</li>
</ul>
<p>PCs on different LANs can be the same ip. If they are same IP on the same LAN, then this will cause data losses.</p>
<h2 id="network-parameters">Network Parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li>inet 192.168.1.25  IP address of a computer in a network</li>
<li>broadcast 192.168.1.255 internal Router ip?</li>
<li>netmask 255.255.255.0 subnet mask. 
Shows that only the last number identifies a host (device) on the network. And there are 254 IPs. This means we gave the last octet (8 bits) for hosts on the network. This number is 2^n -2 (254). One is for the broadcast, the other one I don&#39;t know. And 2^n for the number of subnetworks. Which is 2^24 here.  </li>
<li>Classify subnet according to that netmask ip. A: 255.0.0.0, B:255.255.0.0, C:255.255.255.0</li>
</ul>
