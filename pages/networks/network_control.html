    <h1>Privacy, DNS, Proxy, and more</h1>

    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>In the case of the web, the domain name is converted to IP through DNS. In the case of WRD we need to know the IP of the other computer and the app-port and set it into the Router configuration, which is accesses by typing the router IP (every wi-fi enabled device has an IP) on a browser. The IP of the router is retrieved by using: ip route in linux, and similar in windows.</p>
    <p> I believe in browsers by typing the protocol the browser and the router knows the port, so they send ftp to port 21, http to port 80 of the other computer.</p>

    <h2>Proxy Server</h2>
    <p> It's a computer that asks for a webpage for us, so our IP remains hidden.  Instead of asking for an address straight to the web-server, we ask to the proxy and this (with its IP) asks for the webpage or data.</p>
    <p> The benefit is surfing the web anonymously.  One problem, it doesn't encrypt data, so in the worse scenario user/pass could be detected by hackers.</p>

    <h2>VPN</h2>
    <p> Virtual Private Network It encrypts data, and keeps it private. Ex NordVPN</p>

    <h2>DNS servers</h2>
    <p>It's like phone book (we know the name, get the number). Resolves names to IPs.</p>
    <p>A proxy server can change your IP address, so the web server doesnâ€™t know exactly where you are in the world. It can encrypt your data, so your data is unreadable in transit. And lastly, a proxy server can block access to certain web pages, based on IP address.</p>
