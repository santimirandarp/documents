<h1 id="osi-and-tcp-ip-models">osi and tcp-ip models</h1>
<p>When you walk-in to a situation, you have no idea where the problem is. These Models give us a framework to troubleshoot the problem.</p>
<p>The models split a network in a number of pieces.</p>
<h2 id="open-system-interconnection">Open System Interconnection</h2>
<p>osi divides the network system in 7 layers.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Application</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
<li>Session</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Data Link</li>
<li>Physical</li>
</ol>
<p>Layer 7 software config like Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p>Layer 6 system config like Apache.</p>
<p>Layer 5 Tunnel of data transference between computers. Uses cookies.</p>
<p>Layer 4 controls speed of data transf., windowing. Ports have to do with the communication with layer 5-4. It&#39;s like where (which port) the session logs data to.</p>
<p>Layer 3 Router Config.</p>
<p>Layer 2 Switches. </p>
<p>Layer 1 cables, patch panels, wap, nic etc. Unplugged cables, wrong cables, etc. </p>
<p>_Not all devices are specific of one layer.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-ip-model">tcp-ip model</h2>
<p>tcp-ip is divided in 4 layers.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Application: 7,6,5. Protocols: http, sftp, smb, dns, imap, dhcp, ftp, pop, telnet. Firefox, or Chrome, Outlook etc. make use of protocols on this layer on the client end whereas Apache, Node etc make use on the Server end. PDU: Data.</li>
<li>Transport: 4. Protocols: TCP, UDP. PDU: Segments. </li>
<li>Internet: 3. Protocols: IPv4, IPv6, etc. Notice <strong>ip</strong> on this layer. PDU: Packets/Datagrams. Think of all the router configuration (as it appears on the web gui for the router.)</li>
<li>Network: 2,1. Protocols: Ethernet 802.11 and 802.3,  MAC, ARP, DSL, PPP. PDU: Bits. WAP, NIC. PDU: frames.</li>
</ol>
<p>This model is osi but simplified. </p>
<h2 id="tcp-and-ip-protocols">tcp and ip protocols</h2>
<p>IP or Internet Protocol is a routable protocol. Which means we can have subnetworks, that can be linked using a Router. 
IP protocol is on OS-3. IP makes sure one computer finds another and are properly linked. </p>
<p>Transfer Control Protocol. Windowing. The Window can be thought as an area, and it can be closed or open. Through the window, segments of data are sent in a particular way (theoretically they multiply on every send).</p>
