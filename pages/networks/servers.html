    <h1>Servers</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Servers are computers offering services to other computers (clients). They must be on a network.</li>
      <li>There are specific computers used as servers, but our own computer can be converted into a server.</li>
      <li>Depending on the client-server communication protocol, is the software we install on each end.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Type of servers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>File (ftp, sftp)</li>
      <li>Authentication</li>
      <li>Web (http, https)</li>
      <li>ssh, scp</li>
      <li>smb, sync, library, rtc: share (lan, wan) and edit files/folders. Shared folder for a network. Different protocol than ftp.</li>
      <li>Mail (pop3, smtp, imap)</li>
      <li>dns, dhcp, Firewall, Port Forward.</li>
      <li>Proxy</li>
      <li>VPN</li>
      <li>Database</li>
      <li>BitTorrent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One computer can be multiple servers, it's not just one server on each computer.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>A browser is just a popular http client; filezilla an ftp one. There are other tools using same protocols for communication between devices. Some of those tools are text-based or command line browsers, the http cli-program in linux.</p>
    <p>There is also related software to download webpages, for example wget or curl.</p>
    <p>On the server side, apache is a popular http server, samba an smb server, etc.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>Servers use Xeon processors, redundant power supplies (RSP) so if one dies the system keeps running (ideally it runs 24/7). We can take out and replace it. Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). The computer maintains more than one copy of the data, using many hard drives, if one cracks down, we can replace it, and everything is rebuild. Error-code Correction (ECC) RAM runs a check of the RAM.</p>

    <h2>DNS server</h2>
    <p>It's like a phone book (we know the name, get the number). DNS resolves domain names to IPs. A domain name could be <em>https://www.google.com</em>. If the domain does not exist, we get an error.</p>
    <p>To access any device in the world wide web network, we need to be connected to the wan.</p>

    <h2>Proxy Server</h2>
    <p>It's a computer that asks for a webpage for us, so our IP remains hidden. Instead of asking for an address straight to the web-server, we ask to the proxy and this (with its IP) asks for the webpage or data.</p>
    <p>A proxy server can change your IP address, so the web server doesnâ€™t know exactly where you are in the world. It can encrypt your data, so your data is unreadable in transit. And lastly, a proxy server can block access to certain web pages, based on IP address.</p>
    <p> The benefit is surfing the web anonymously.  One problem, it doesn't encrypt data, so in the worse scenario user/pass could be detected by hackers.</p>

    <h2>vpn server</h2>
    <p> Virtual Private Network It encrypts data, and keeps it private. Ex NordVPN</p>

    <h2>ftp server</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use port 21 to be secured?</li>
      <li>exchange files with ftp-server. `ftp` on command line or gui clients.</li> 
      <li>Apart from port 21, it's not a secure way to transfer files.</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
      <dt>Example</dt>
      <dd>On a browser's address bar: ftp://address </dd>
      <dd>cli: ftp adress</dd>
      <dd>Filezilla: write adress in search box.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Without a secure connection hackers see anything transferred over the network. This is not a secure method to buy things, log into social networks etc. But can do simple stuff.</p>
    <p>For sensible data SFTP should be used instead. SFTP uses secure shell, encrypts the data. Port 22.</p>
    <p>In any case, we need the IP, a user and a password.</p>

    <h2>http server</h2>
    <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol Access <b>public</b> files of a server. It's possible (<kbd>C-S</kbd>) to download the html, not just the source code, but all linked files even if they are in a different domain.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On a Browser Address Bar: <em>http://www.domainName.subDomain</em></li>
      <li>Using wget and curl: wget/curl [options] webaddress; or GET, POST, HTTP + webadress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>BitTorrent</h2>
    <p>Bit torrent is another protocol. The network is also a server-client architecture. But instead of being centralized network - where all data is server by the server,  each computer acts as a client and a server.</p>
    <p>So BitTorrent is a protocol useful to set up a descentralized network.</p>
    <p>There is no Unique Source of Power, but many. In this case, the software we install is both client and server. It's not like a web where there is an Apache Server and Firefox client.  There is, for example, uTorrent, and other software being both roles at once. 
    </p>
    <p>We can of course, configure the client-side and the server-side. We can even shutdown the server.
    </p>
    <p>This Descentralized architecture, where we are serving file to others, is called Peer-To-Peer, or P2P.</p>

    <p><a href="../web/backend.html">See backend</a> for instructions setting up http servers.</p>

    <h2>In a few words</h2>
    <p>So setting up a network we can share stuff between computers. Networks are composed by a client and a server. And we can configure the server to serve different things: websites, files, access to folders, or to cameras, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>There are sometimes many types of servers useful for the same task. For example, a web server can be used to serve files. But usually there are specific protocols (or a few of them) good for specific tasks.</p>
    <p>We can transfer files using HTTP, SMB, BitTorrent, SSH...!</p>
    <p>There are also many different clients we can install to interact with a server.</p>
    <p>There is a nice symmetry in all this. All clients (Firefox, utorrent) etc. Will need a link, and sometimes a password. What is this? Well, with some variation, is the location of a resource on the network.</p>
