    <h1>Servers</h1>
    <p>Servers are computers offering services to other computers. They must be on a network.</p>
    <p>There are specific computers used as servers, but our own computer can be converted into a server. They are not really made for this and will struggle with large number of users, etc. More on this later.</p>
    <p>When we use the services of server, we (anything in our computer) are clients. Web Browsers like Mozilla Firefox are HTTP (or web) client , so it's a client that uses services of a server. Namely, a web server. We can access FTP servers using Filezilla, or any other FTP client.</p>
    <p>In general, we connect to particular types of servers using particular clients.</p>

    <h2>Set Up</h2>

    <h2>Type of servers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>File</li>
      <li>FTP</li>
      <li>Authentication Servers</li>
      <li>Web</li>
      <li>Mail</li>
      <li>DNS</li>
      <li>Proxy</li>
      <li>VPN</li>
      <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One computer can be multiple servers, it's not just one server on each computer.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>Normally servers use Xeon processors, redundant power supplies (RSP) so if one dies the system keeps running (ideally it runs 24/7). We can take out and replace it. Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). The computer maintains more than one copy of the data, using many hard drives, if one cracks down, we can replace it, and everything is rebuild. Error-code Correction (ECC) RAM runs a check of the RAM.</p>
    
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The server type correlates with a program. Security or Authentication server, so we log in and gain access to a subset of directories in the server. Apache, Nginx are for web servers, SQL for databases.

    <h2>DNS server</h2>
    <p>It's like phone book (we know the name, get the number). DNS resolves domain names to IPs. A domain name could be google.com. If the domain does not exit, we get an error.</p>
    <p>To access any device in the world wide web (network) we need to be connected to WAN. This is done using a Router/Switch. Which in turn needs to be configured. The IP of the router is retrieved by using: ip route in linux, and similar in windows.(any device on a network is assigned an IP).</p>

    <h2>Proxy Server</h2>
    <p>It's a computer that asks for a webpage for us, so our IP remains hidden. Instead of asking for an address straight to the web-server, we ask to the proxy and this (with its IP) asks for the webpage or data.</p>
    <p>A proxy server can change your IP address, so the web server doesnâ€™t know exactly where you are in the world. It can encrypt your data, so your data is unreadable in transit. And lastly, a proxy server can block access to certain web pages, based on IP address.</p>
    <p> The benefit is surfing the web anonymously.  One problem, it doesn't encrypt data, so in the worse scenario user/pass could be detected by hackers.</p>
    <h2>VPN server</h2>
    <p> Virtual Private Network It encrypts data, and keeps it private. Ex NordVPN</p>
