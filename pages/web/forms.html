<p>
Form: Wraps all the form. Attributes: action, method. Action is a redirection, method get or post.
Input is the most common form element. The most important attributes are: type, name and value. Others are: placeholder, 
required, etc. It's good to know the basic types. The ones in bold do no need a value attribute (any value given will be a default).
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>text, search, email, url, age, textarea</b>. May be wrapped in a label.
  </li>
  <li> checkbox, radio. Always wrapped in label.  </li>
  <li>Button</li>
  <li>select-option. Select needs a name, the value is on the options.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Label this is for the user. It binds a piece of text to the for element. Always should use the <em>for</em> attribute to make should the label is understood by SRs.</p>
<p>Fieldset-legend: to group widgets with the same purpose. Radio buttons should be nested inside a fieldset.</p>
