    <h1>Units and Fonts</h1>

    <h2 id="units">Units</h2>
    <p>Units</p>
    <p>pixels, cm, mm, viewports, rem v em</p>
    <p>pixels are literally the small pieces composing the screen,
    physical units: px, cm, mm, inches.
    viewports % of the browser&#39;s window
    em:units relative to the first parent element with specified pixels or physical units. Otherwiseto body or html.
    rem: root em. Relative to the html (root) tag. The default is usually 16px.</p>

    <h3>REM v EM</h3>   
    <p>change html {font-size: N px;}. All elements with <em>REM </em> = root em will 
    resize accordingly. <em>em</em> is relative to nearest parent element size. If only <em>em</em> is used, then the result is equivalent to that of <em>rem</em>.</p>
    <p>There are still <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp' title='problem in IE9'>problems in IE9</a>.  adding</p> 

    <h2>Fonts </h2>
    <p> There are generally three types of sites where you can obtain fonts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An online font service: This is a site that <b>stores</b> and serves the fonts for you.</li>
      <li>Free download (there may still be some license conditions). Examples: Font Squirrel, dafont, and Everything Fonts. In this case we store the font locally. And then on our server.</li>
      <li>A paid font distributor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Font Squirrel, dafont </h3>
    <p> We download a font in otf or ttf, and although those are webfonts, it's recommended (w3c) to use woff. We can convert it using font squirrel too. And there are free tools also (I use a github  repo). Font Squirrel web-font (woff) generator is light years better. (it retrieves even the bulletproof css).</p>
    <p> Advanced topics: unicode range, stretch, etc. Also Variable Fonts seems to be interesting.</p>
    <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
    <p> Easy to use. Download or Link in html or css.</p>
    <h3>Web Safe Fonts</h3>
    <p>There are also fonts normally available in any OS, and those can be included as fallback</p>
    <h3>Variable Fonts</h3>
    <h3>Fonts Brief</h3>
    <p>Download fonts from anywhere as long as the license is fine. Then upload to font squirrel and voala, we get them forever. Even to use as system font.</p>
    <p>The other good option is google fonts.</p>
