  <h1>Package Manager</h1>
  <p>Official, Launchpad and Own repos are <em>program pools</em>. They can mostly be managed with apt, which is
  called
  <em>package manager</em>. Launchpad and Own repos must be added to sources list for updates.
  </p>
  <p>A PM is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and
  removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.</p>
  <p>
  A PM deals with packages: data in archive files. Packages contain metadata: software's name, purpose,
  version number, vendor, checksum, list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon
  installation, metadata is stored in a local package database.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Snap, Gdebi, dpkg, apt, aptitude, are examples for linux packages. They are <b>not</b> the same.</li>
    <li> npm is the PM for nodejs. Javascript packages.
    </li>
    <li>
      pip for python
    </li>
    <li>
      none of them have <abbr title="Graphical User Interfaces">GUIs</abbr> but <abbr
                              title="Command Line Interfaces">CLis</abbr> (can be found at muon pm).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Linux PMs
  </h3>
  <p>
  A new package manager for linux is snap (<code>sudo apt-get install snap</code>)
  </p>
  <p>
  Debian and debian based systems (DBS) use <code>dpkg</code> as a PM (low level). It is the
  mother of all package managers. <code>Apt</code> or its 'twin' <code>aptitude</code> for
  high level. The file extension of the packages is <code>.deb</code>
  </p>
  <h4>
    What do high level package managers offer as different from <code>dpgk</code>?
  </h4>
  <p>
  apt executes <code>dpkg</code> but also look for dependencies and offer us to install them. It's different from gdebi, which is a package installer. Apt offers ways to edit sources lists, upgrade and update the system, autoremove, etc etc.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Linux Package Installers: gdebi and QApt
  </h3>
  Both offer optional GUI besides CLI. <code>.deb</code> file must be on the computer (usually downloaded from
  websites). PIs add info to sources list for updates and care about dependencies (automatically installed).
  There is no guarantee that .deb files will be added to sources.list and updated automatically when runnning 
  <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</code>. This is not the case with launchpad, and the reason 
  why it is usually preferred.
  <!-- apt-get ./foo.deb will make the same than gdebi or QApt :) -->
  <h4>
    Fedora Linux Branch
  </h4>
  rpm instead of dpkg for others non dbs. File extesion .rpm
  <h4>
    From Fedora to Ubuntu
  </h4>
  .rmp files can be converted to .deb files -and reverse- using alien tool.
  <h3>
    Software centers for GUIs and CLIs packages.
  </h3>
  <p>
  Softare centers are graphical interfaces to manage software (sources taken from sources lists).
  Examples are Discover/Synaptic/Ubuntu Software Center, etc.
  There are also graphical interfaces for CLI programs like <abbr title="?">MUON</abbr> in lubuntu.
  </p>
  <p> Nodejs, for example,
  is not in discover but in muon.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What is sources lists?
  </h3>
  <p>
  For DBS updates sources are located in /sources.lists, and that's the files the command looks for to update.
  Might be sources from canonical, or PPAs, etc.
  For installing programms, those read dependencies (located in the head of the .deb package/file) and offer
  to install them too.

  <h3>Example using dpkg and gdebi</h3>
  <p>Install Google Chrome :)</p>
  <p>
  <code>.deb</code> packages can be downloaded manually or using <code>wget</code>, for google chrome (which
  is different from chromium)
  it
  is:
  <pre>
        wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //get the file
        sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //option 1. || -i for install
        sudo gdebi google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.debc//option 2 w gdebi PI.
        sudo apt-get -f install // Errors? use run this and re-run the dpgk command.
  </pre>

  <h3>
    Install compressed files <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.tar.bz2</code>
  </h3>
  <p>
  Sometimes it's required to download a <code>.tar.gz</code> and manually
  install it.
  Uncompress the files with some software tool. Go to the directory take a look at <b>readme</b> or install.
  Classically, running
  </p>
  <pre>
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

  </pre>
  should do the job (tar files are different than .deb). (So make is some kind of package installer too.)
