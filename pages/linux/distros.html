    <h1>Linux Distros</h1>
  <h2>Differences between linux versions, flavors &amp; distros.</h2>
  <p>Let's take Ubuntu. It comes with a Unity Desktop Environment and some repos in sources list. Mint uses same repos but different DE (MATE). 
  Lubuntu uses similar repos and again, different DE.
  They use a different subset of programs from the main repos. All are different <em>flavors</em> of the same distro.</p>
  <p>At the same time, Ubuntu derives from Debian but has its own repos. These are different <em>distros</em>.</p>
  <p>Everytime we pick up a flavor, it has many versions. There is usually a LTS version and another one suitable for curious users. Official ubuntu flavors all update nearly on the same time, and use the same version numbers. Right now the latest LTS is 19.04 and 19.10 is the short term version.</p>
  <p>There are also many unofficial distros and flavors.</p>
