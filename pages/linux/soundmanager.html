  <h2>Sound Manager</h2>
  <p>Alsa connects the audio card and the operating system. It also provides an sound controller, i.e an user interface 
  called alsamixer, to tweak the volume. Another sound controller is pulseaudio. Pulseaudio still uses Alsa for audio card and OS communication.</p>
  <p>Jack is a more advanced sound controller. Where any given application makes use of sound control will be up to the application developers. Some applications will only use ALSA, some need PulseAudio, some need JACK.</p>
  <p>pavucontrol is the front end for this sound controlers (a volume controller).</p>
