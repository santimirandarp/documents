    <p>Web development is about building websites. There are 3 main actors: 
    </p>
    <ol> 
      <li>webpages</li>
      <li>web server</li>
      <li>web client (browser)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="browsers-i">Browsers I</h2>
    <p>A webpage is very similar to a text file. As Microsoft Word reads .doc files, Web Browsers read .html files. Browsers read local files or request files to the server through a protocol (HTTP). Browsers need an address, called URL or IP, to find and retrieve the file (website).</p>
    <h2 id="the-process-of-seeing-a-webpage">The process of seeing a webpage</h2>
    <p>So you open the browser and type an URL. The browser looks for the file in a remote computer (the web server). Then a webpage or an error is retrieved and displayed on your screen. The browser uses the GET 
    method (from the http protocol) to retrieve the html file, as well as image files (jpg, png) and some other files too. Each adds to the page load-time.</p>
    <h2 id="browsers-ii">Browsers II</h2>
    <p>Once the page is retrieved, many things occur. The Browser generates the DOM or Document Object Model. This is a tree-like representation of our HTML document. Each branch is a Node. Nodes are elements, attributes or text. This structure allows developers manipulate the website using javascript.
