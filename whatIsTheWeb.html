<h1 id="general-ideas-about-web-development">How does the Web work?</h1>
<p>Web development is about building websites. There are 3 main actors: 
</p>
<ol> 
<li>webpages</li>
<li>web server</li>
<li>browsers</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-a-website-and-a-web-server-">Webpage and Web Server</h2>
<p>A website is a text file. Webpages are stored in Web Servers. 
Web Servers are computers with a huge memory, and host clients&#39; files. 
Sometimes web servers are referred to as hosts.</p>
<h2 id="browsers-i">Browsers I</h2>
<p>As Microsoft Word reads .doc files, Web Browsers read .html files. 
Browsers read local files or request files to the server through a 
protocol (HTTP). 
Browsers need an address, called URL or IP, to find and retrieve the file (website). </p>
<h2 id="the-process-of-seeing-a-webpage">The process of seeing a webpage</h2>
<p>So you open the browser and write an URL. The browser looks for the file(s) in a remote computer! (the web server).
And if succeds, the webpage is retrieved.</p>
<h2 id="browsers-ii">Browsers II</h2>
<p>The Browser also generates the DOM or Document Object Model. 
This is a tree-like representation of our HTML document. 
Each branch is a Node. Nodes are elements, attributes or text. 
This structure allows us to learn how to manipulate the website. 
Browsers offer also developer tools. </p>
