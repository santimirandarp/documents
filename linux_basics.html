<h2>Install Linux (USB-stick)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dwld iso using <code>zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/path/to/img.iso</code>
        or <code>http http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/path/to/img.uso</code> or bit torrent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make it bootable:  <em>mkusb</em>, <em>disk creator</em>, <em>unetbootin</em> is another option.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="filesystem-hierarchy-standard">Filesystem hierarchy standard</h2>
<p>Layout for the root (<code>/</code>), the beginning of the OS. Do not confuse w root folder. Here root means the beginning, the top of the system.</p>
<ul><li><strong>usr</strong>: System Wide apps are installed there. 
        <ul><li><strong>/usr/bin</strong>: program files live here.</li>
            <li><strong>/usr/sbin</strong>: program files only accessible to the root live here.</li> 
            <li><strong>/usr/lib*</strong>: libraries are small pieces of software shared by programs.</li>
            <li><strong>/usr/share</strong>: share contains many things like wallpapers, icons, and much more stuff. </li>
            <li><strong>/usr/local/</strong>: contains programs installed from source. For example <code>youtube-dl</code> 
was installed using github instructions and sits therein.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>etc</strong>: etcetera. contains system wide configuration and settings. For example
<code>/etc/apt/</code> contains config files for <em>apt</em>. In this case, the config file is 
the source of software. Config files can be many things.</li>
<li><strong>opt</strong>:contains some propietary software. Example: google chrome.</li>
<li><strong>snap</strong>: programs installed through snap package manager live on this folder and are isolated, self contained 
packages.</li>
<li><strong>home</strong>: this contains a list of users. We can access normally only to ours, and any of them with root 
privileges. Under <code>/home/username/</code> there is a whole bunch of new things detailed on the next section</code></li>
<li><strong>boot</strong>: all info the system needs to boot.</li>
<li><strong>dev</strong>: devices. hard drives and partitions sda, sda1, sda2 (numbers being partitions, sda the hard drive)</li>
for example sources lists.</li>
<li><strong>media</strong>: all mounted devices &#39;d be there.</li>
<li><strong>proc</strong>:pseudofiles about processes.</li>
<li> <strong>run, srv, tmp</strong>:erased when reset system.</li>
<li><strong>sys</strong>:system. advanced.</li>
<li><strong>/root</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Home Directory</h3>
<p>So the root directory contains many folders. The most important ones for beginners are: usr and etc.
Programs and even wallpapers are on usr. Config files on etc. All of these are system-scoped settings, 
and this means for all users. </p>
<p>The home directory contains the following directories:Desktop, Downloads..., dirs and files we create, 
and .dotfiles as well as .dotdirectories. dot in a file hides the file. There are some important 
dot directories and files:</p>
<ol>
<li>.bashrc, .bash_aliases, .profile</li>
<li>.local, .config, .cache</li>
<li>.program (.vimrc etc. etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first one are config files where variables are stored, exported, etc.
The second ones are directories. .local contain user scoped programs; .config contains user-scoped 
config files (this config overwrittes etc config files as expected). The lastone might be a files or a directory. 
They should be placed under .config but for some reason they are not, and this cant be changed as the files are 
created on every program-session (if they do not exist). They are usually config files.
</p>
<h3>Symlinks in the filesystem</h3>
<p>bin, sbin and all libs are symlinks, not real folders. All of them link 
to a correspondent folder under <code>usr</code>. For example, <code>bin</code>
is really a link to <code>usr/bin</code> and so on. </p>

<h2 id="windows-and-linux">Windows and Linux</h2>
<p>Linux start is on the root directory, instead of C drive. System &amp; program files are stores in different locations (bin, sbin, lib, usr) not  in one as C:program files. Linux cares about capitalisation. New users can be created similar to windows, and can&#39;t access other users accounts.</p>

<h2>Differences between linux flavors &amp; distros.</h2>
<p>TAKE UBUNTU. It comes with a desktop (Unity) and some repos in sources list. Mint uses same repos but different desktop (MATE). 
Lubuntu uses same repos and again, different desktop.
They use a different subset of programs from the main repos it updates more frequently than debian. All are different DISTROS, same flavor.</p>
<p>At the same time, linux derives from DEBIAN but has its own repos. So these are different FLAVORS.</p>
<h2>Variables, Symlinks, Aliases</h2>
<h3>Setting a Variable in Linux</h3>
<p>Every now and then we have to set up a variable. There are many ways to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>MYVAR=name</code> sets up a session variable (useful on the same terminal). ex:
LINUX='cd ~/a/b/c' and executed as $LINUX.</li>
<li>for user-scoped <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile/</code> etc. <code>export MYVAR=name</code>.</li> 
<li>System wide, persitent can be set on <code>/etc/profile</code> as <code> export MYVAR=name</code>
</li>
<li>System Wide, persistent are also set on <code>/etc/environment/</code>
Some system wide stuff can be found at <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>. This file is overwritten by user-scoped bash config file (bashrc). I've changed the way it outputs the PS1 which is the prompt, so it doesn't prints the absolute path, but only the last folder (pwd helps with the full path f it is needed). This way the prompt is not overloaded of words. 
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Sources</h4>
<p>See https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-environment.htm for help.</p>
<p>This type of variables are used by other programs. For example, when typing <code> :edit </code> in <em> broot
</em> the program invokes the $EDITOR variable that should be set to <code>/usr/bin/vim</code> or some editor. 
</p>
<p>the command env outputs all the environment variables. set prints all the shell variables.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-program-to-path">Add a program to $PATH</h3>
<p>echo $PATH  prints all directories added to the path variable. Variables in linux are with the pound sign. Add them on 
.profile by editing it like so: PATH=/directory/to/add:$PATH</p>
<p>On sass, for example, for global installing, the package can be downloaded from github and then the file added to the path, where the path points to the binarie/program/executable. A similar (but not equivalent) installatino  can be achieved using &#39;npm install -g sass&#39;</p>
<h2>Example Case: Lubuntu</h2>
<p>Lubuntu defaults on an Ubuntu core system, LXQt Desktop Environment allowing startup apps and its 
configuration where we can configurate any manager as window managers, login managers; 
brightness, appearance, icons themes, screensaver; also comes with  Openbox window manager, 
Openbox Menu, Alsa as a sound manager, some Network Manager, etc. etc. All this can be 
changed, even the Desktop Environment.</p>
<p>In any distro, for example Ubuntu, we can install the server with different 
desktop environments, and also tweak all the previous managers.</p>

<h2 id="linux-installation-methods">Software Sources</h2>
<p>Software Sources aka Package Repositories, it's the places where linux look at to find programs. In the end, any of them is a web address pointing to the <code>.deb</code> files. There are 3 main software sources (repos etc) depending on the web host.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        Official </dt>
    <dd>Official repos, default source for <code>sudo apt/aptitude install programName</code>.
        These are found in sources list.</dd>
    <dt>
        Launchpad </dt>
    <dd>Launchpad is <abbr title="Personal Package Archive">PPA</abbr> repos.
        It can be added as an apt source (editing the sources list).
        <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:repoName</code>
        creates the file: <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/repoName</code>
        and contains:
        <code>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/programName disco main</code>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Own Server with Repos </dt>
    <dd>
        Launchpad is a cheap host. But we might own a server. Then...
        <code>sudo add-apt-repository http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu</code>
        a line is added to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> (the list of software sources):
        <code>deb http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu saucy main</code>
        <p>
            Taking a close look, PPA is added the same way, just a bit pro because is a trusted source.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Snap and Ubuntu Make</dt>
        <dd> ... </dd>
<dt> Remove and Edit Sources</dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove using <code>apt remove package_name</code>.</p>
<p> <code>sources.list</code> can be modified from terminal or 
from discover -> sources, graphically. Deselect is equivalent to comment out, and they can also be removed.</code>          
    </dd>
</dl>

</p>

<h2>Package Manager</h2>
<p>Official, Launchpad and Own repos are <em>program pools</em>. They can mostly be managed with apt, which is
    called
    <em>package manager</em>. Launchpad and Own repos must be added to sources list for updates.
</p>
<p>A PM is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and
    removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>
    A PM deals with packages: data in archive files. Packages contain metadata: software's name, purpose,
    version number, vendor, checksum, list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon
    installation, metadata is stored in a local package database.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Snap, Gdebi, dpkg, apt, aptitude, are examples for linux packages. They are <strong>not</strong> the same.</li>
    <li> npm is the PM for nodejs. Javascript packages.
    </li>
    <li>
        pip for python
    </li>
    <li>
        none of them have <abbr title="Graphical User Interfaces">GUIs</abbr> but <abbr
            title="Command Line Interfaces">CLis</abbr> (can be found at muon pm).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Linux PMs
</h3>
<p>
    A new package manager for linux is snap (<code>sudo apt-get install snap</code>)
</p>
<p>
    Debian and debian based systems (DBS) use <code>dpkg</code> as a PM (low level). It is the
    mother of all package managers. <code>Apt</code> or its 'twin' <code>aptitude</code> for
    high level. The file extension of the packages is <code>.deb</code>
</p>
<h4>
    What do high level package managers offer as different from <code>dpgk</code>?
</h4>
<p>
    apt executes <code>dpkg</code> but also look for dependencies and offer us to install them. It's different from gdebi, which is a package installer. Apt offers ways to edit sources lists, upgrade and update the system, autoremove, etc etc.
</p>
<h3>
    Linux Package Installers: gdebi and QApt
</h3>
Both offer optional GUI besides CLI. <code>.deb</code> file must be on the computer (usually downloaded from
websites). PIs add info to sources list for updates and care about dependencies (automatically installed).
There is no guarantee that .deb files will be added to sources.list and updated automatically when runnning 
<code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</code>. This is not the case with launchpad, and the reason 
why it is usually preferred.
<!-- apt-get ./foo.deb will make the same than gdebi or QApt :) -->
<h4>
    Fedora Linux Branch
</h4>
rpm instead of dpkg for others non dbs. File extesion .rpm
<h4>
    From Fedora to Ubuntu
</h4>
.rmp files can be converted to .deb files -and reverse- using alien tool.
<h3>
    Software centers for GUIs and CLIs packages.
</h3>
<p>
    Softare centers are graphical interfaces to manage software (sources taken from sources lists).
    Examples are Discover/Synaptic/Ubuntu Software Center, etc.
    There are also graphical interfaces for CLI programs like <abbr title="?">MUON</abbr> in lubuntu.
</p>
<p> Nodejs, for example,
    is not in discover but in muon.
</p>

<h3>
    What is sources lists?
</h3>
<p>
    For DBS updates sources are located in /sources.lists, and that's the files the command looks for to update.
    Might be sources from canonical, or PPAs, etc.
    For installing programms, those read dependencies (located in the head of the .deb package/file) and offer
    to install them too.

</p>
<h3>Example using dpkg and gdebi</h3>
<p>Install Google Chrome :)</p>
<p>
    <code>.deb</code> packages can be downloaded manually or using <code>wget</code>, for google chrome (which
    is different from chromium)
    it
    is:
    <pre>
        wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //get the file
        sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //option 1. || -i for install
        sudo gdebi google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.debc//option 2 w gdebi PI.
        sudo apt-get -f install // Errors? use run this and re-run the dpgk command.
    </pre>

<h3>
    Install compressed files <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.tar.bz2</code>
</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes it's required to download a <code>.tar.gz</code> and manually
    install it.
    Uncompress the files with some software tool. Go to the directory take a look at <strong>readme</strong> or install.
    Classically, running
</p>
<pre>
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
    
</pre>
should do the job (tar files are different than .deb). (So make is some kind of package installer too.)

<h2>Sound Manager</h2>
<p>Alsa connects the system's kernel and the audio card. It also provides a user interface 
through alsamixer, to change some settings. This last step can be also done using pulseaudio.</p>
<h2>LXQt Desktop Environment</h2>
The desktop environment comes with many applications or programs. Power management, 
global keybindings, the runner. All config files for those apps. And the appearance, brightness. 
<h2>Window Manager</h2> 
<p>In lubuntu, the default WM is openbox. Openbox handles:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The window borders, decorations, placement</li>
    <li>what is triggered with keybindings, clicks</li>
    <li>the menu icons, text and arrangement</li>
    <li>session start</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first two can be found on the config file for openbox.
You should copy the file from /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml to ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml to edit it, if that file does not already exist. The file contains a ton of options. 
Most interesting stuff is keybindings. Again with a myriad of options.</p>
<p>The third one is managed by openbox-menu, don't know where the config file is</p>
<p>After installing openbox, or if it comes installed, a new session option is available
for us. It is a complex thing and I don't know more than this.
</p>

<h2>Where do programs live in linux?</h2>
<p>There are many package installers now. There is the traditional installers and snap, flatpack, umake.
We can divide installations in 2 groups according to permissions:</p>
</p>
Sudo, cross-user installed programs (binary files) sit on <code>/usr/bin</code> or <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. Also <code>/snap/bin</code> for snap-installed packages. <code>/bin</code> and <code>/sbin</code> are 
the bare bones of linux and programs shouldn't be there. Sudo is needed on those programs exactly for the sake of putting the program and dependencies on the root directory structure. This are global-scoped installations. 
</p>
<p>
User scoped installations 
follow the similar paths <code>~/.local/bin</code>. This installation do not require sudo powers. 
<code>umake</code> installed packages sit on <code>/home/santi/.local/share/umake/bin</code>. </p>
<p> Some programs might ask for adding a the address to the $PATH variable, after putting the binary files somewhere. Of course we can put the binaries on <code>/usr/bin</code> or <code>~/.local/bin</code> and all should be good.
In case we add a new directory, the path to the bin can be set into <code>~.profile</code> or changing <code>/etc/environment
</code>. In any case afterwards <<code>source ~.profile</code> or <code>source /etc/environment
</code> has to be run to activate the changes. If we change <code> /etc/environment</code> it might be necessary to source the 
profile anyways. We can check that typing <code>echo $PATH</code> on the terminal.</p>
<h3>Another Anomaly</h3>
<p>If we do not write <code>sudo npm 'node_module_name' </code>, and this might be a good idea as we don't know how safe node is, the packages will 
be in the user directory <code>~/node_modules/bin</code>. My Laptop for example contains <em>gulp, sass and live-server</em>. This is important because for running those commands we need to add that directory to the $PATH variable!</p>
<h2>Firefox</h2>
<p> Developer Edition is installed with umake, installed with apt. Then the path must be added to the path variable and as the programm is user-scoped the variable should be declared accordingly. So the proper place is ~/.profile 
and remember we have to use export. There is a warning that populates the screen. It can be solved using 
<code>sudo apt-get remove fcitx; sudo apt-get autoremove </code>. Then the warning dissapears and everything seems to work fine.</p>
<h2>Discussion of a few Programs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bluedevil: useful for sending files to devices, selecting hardware like bluetooth mice, 
connecting to speakers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
<h3 id="command-line-details">Command line details</h3>
<p>user@computer:directory usertype </p>
<p>example santi@lenovo:~$ (regular user) or santi@lenovo:$# (root)</p>
<h3>
Useful Binaries</h3>
<p>locate, find: look for files.
grep: inside files.
wc 
mkdir -p ~/newdir1/newdir2 
</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>grep, sort, awk, less
Filters usefulness comes from pipes (|). Examples:
ls -l | grep "Aug" | sort +4n |awk '{print $4} |  less 
'When we do not give a file to a filter, they take tha STDOUT as the input file.'
</p>
<h3>Shortcurts</h3>
## ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
/usr/bin/env also (env) --> show environment variables. 
/etc/environment -> place to write variables
or in etc/profile using export
unset varName --> removes variables from environment or from shell 
#Bash aliases are an ubuntu invention. Normally they are on .bashrc and variables on .profile.
#In lubuntu anyways is ok to set aliases on bash_aliases


## REDIRECTION 
When commands & bins run many things happen: stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2) are open
An exit code is generated but not output. It is stored 
in the exit status '?=exit status'  accessed as $?, print using echo $?. 
Counter intuitive: 0 sucessful, unsucessful.

Chaining of commands using exit code
grep 'hello' bash_aliases && echo 'find it!' || echo 'didnt find it!'
ls -a ||  echo 'I like your mom'

Output redirection:
redirection of anything appearing on the terminal to a file: firefox-developer 2 > /dev/null

Processes: fg, bg, C-z
firefox-developer & # the ampersand sets it as a bg process.

    <h3>npm and related</h3>
        <p>npm allows us to install webdev-related programs. 
        Also has an option to initialize the project. 
        In this process we create a packages.json file and 
	every time an plug-in is installed (under node_modules) 
	the file is updated.</p>
	<p>Not all the programs follow the same procedure 
	for installation though. Normally it's just <code>npm install -g program</code> the <code>-g</code> being optional as it allows the program to be run out of this project by running a simple command. In the case of gulp both are necessary <code>npm
		install gulp-cli -g</code> and 
	npm install gulp --save-dev</code>. Afterwards we create the <code>gulpfile.js</code> file.</p>
	<p>In brief, a project that is gonna be managed with npm 
	has to be initialized, and then all dependencies must be installed (reading the installation procedure).</p>
	<h3>Web-related programs</h3>
	<p> First let's list them </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mozilla developer: installed with umake</li>
		<li> VSCode: installed with snap package manager</li>
		<li>lynx, w3m: CLI browser and html viewer. apt install</li>
		<li> Zeal: dwld and access offline docs for programming related stuff.</li>
	</ul>
