    </div>
   
    <h2>Loading</h2>
    <p>In the most straightforward approach images can be loaded using</p>
    <code>&lt;img src='path/to/images/sourceImage.format'&gt;</code>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <dl>
	<dt>store on an <em>/images</em> folder &amp; use <em>descriptive_filename</em></dt>
  	<dd>for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> purposes.</dd>
	<dt>on the same server (avoid using external urls).</dt>
        <dd>avoid links breaks or modified images.</dd>
        <dd>A DNS search + GET takes more time to load the image.</dd>
           
        <dt>Use <code>alt</code> attribute. Text is useful for
	users with:</dt>
            <dd>impaired vision</dd>
            <dd>turned off images (ex. in many phones) </dd>
            <dd>text-only browsers as Lynx</dd> 
  	    <dd>search engines</dd>
     
	    <dt>decorative images use background-image.</dt>
	    <dd>they dont add to the content and do not need to be described</dd>
	    <dd>if you really need a decorative &lt;img&gt; use alt=&#39;&#39;</dd>
	   
	    <dt>If an external image is used, be it on the public domain.
            Two useful resources: <dt>
                <dd>unsplash.it/h/w</dd>
                <dd>picsum.photos/h/w/?random</dd>
		<dt>width and height</dt>
		<dd>Use always to avoid flickering and reserve space</dd>
    </dl>

	    <h3>About the <em>alt</em> attribute</h3>

	    <ul>
       		 <li>alt attribute is required for validation
       		(use html validator) </li>
        	<li>images inside links add border:0 (to prevent IE9 and earlier
            	of displaying a border)</li>
            	<li>Minify the images to reduce load time + 
                data-transfer.</li>
    	    </ul>

    <h3>Loading Time, Resolution, Retina Displays</h3>
    <p>In the bare minimum and image loading should look like this:
    <code>&lt;img alt='description' width='300' height='400' src='path/to/pic'/&bg;</code></p>
    <p>Common computer-screen resolutions are 72dpi</p>
    <p>    An image should be displayed on its natural size (area covered by its number of pixels). 
    Why? Too big sizes make it grainy, too small (if too small) waste bandwidth and increase load time.</p>
    <p>It's ok to strech/shrink but avoiding extremes. <em>srcset</em> attribute 
    allows to include many different resolutions and sizes.</p>
    <!-- In case of having a set of images we should try to edit them properly to the same size, or at least same ratio. -->
    
    <h4>Example Case</h4>
    <p>Let's say we want to upload a 1500px square image, and make it available for retina displays and responsive.</p>
    <p>We could <code>.image {width:100%}</code> for responsiveness. But yet it loses resolution when stretching out or 
    wastes bandwidth when shrinking in. We can add <em>srcset</em> and upload diff sizes for different viewports. 
    So it still streches or shrinks but not that much. </p>
    <!--be careful not altering the aspect ratio of the image -->
	
    <h3>Control Of Backgrounds</h3>

    <p>This is an interesting approach to control the 
 display of a background for different devices. It uses 
 min-device-width instead of device-width, the difference being that min-device-width doesnt pay attention to the viewport. 
 Both can be used though.</p>
