    <span>Loading, Best Practices, Theory </span>
    </div>
   
    <h2>Loading</h2>
    <p>In the most straightforward approach images can be loaded using</p>
    <code>&lt;img src='path/to/images/sourceImage.format'&gt;</code>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <dl>
	<dt>On Storage</dt>
	<dd>Store under <em>/images</em> folder. Also use <em>descriptive_filename</em>.
	This optimizes <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> (and we get more views).</dd>
	<dd>
	Store Locally, i.e  on the same server than the website, and avoid using external urls.
        Use external links is prone to links breaks or modified images. Also a DNS search + GET takes more time to load the image.
	</dd>
           <dd>If an external image is used, be it on the public domain.
            example picsum.photos/h/w?random </dd>
        <dt>Use <code>alt</code> attribute. Text is useful for
	users with:</dt>
            <dd>impaired vision</dd>
            <dd>turned off images (ex. in many phones) </dd>
            <dd>text-only browsers as Lynx</dd> 
  	    <dd>search engines</dd>
     
	    <dt> Background-image</dt>
	    <dd>When images do not add to the content use background images. 
	    Also those do not need to be described (as with alt).</dd>
	    <dd>if really need to include decorative &lt;img&gt; use alt=&#39;&#39;</dd>
 
		<dt>width and height</dt>
		<dd>Use to avoid flickering and reserve space</dd>
		<dt>use of srcset</dt>
		<dd>The <strong>picture</strong> element can be used to include an image and sources with media queries 
		to select an image depending on the device. I can be also optimized for different than 72 dpis.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p> So basically: store locally, use <strong>alt</strong> attribute, width and height whenever possible. Background-images for non content/decorative images.</p>

    <h3>About the <em>alt</em> attribute</h3>

	    <ul>
       		 <li>alt attribute is required for validation
       		(use html validator) </li>
        	<li>images inside links add border:0 (to prevent IE9 and earlier
            	of displaying a border)</li>
            	<li>Minify the images to reduce load time + 
                data-transfer.</li>
    	    </ul>

   <h2>srcset attribute</h2>
    <p>In the bare minimum and image loading should look like this:
    <code>&lt;img alt='description' width='300' height='400' src='path/to/images/pic'/&bg;</code></p>
    <p>Common computer-screen resolutions are 72dpi. 
    An image should be displayed on its natural size (area covered by its number of pixels). 
    Why? Too big sizes make it grainy, too small (if too small) waste bandwidth and increase load time.
    But this is not practical. It's ok to strech/shrink but avoiding extremes. <em>srcset</em> attribute 
    allows to include many different resolutions and sizes.</p>
    <!-- In case of having a set of images we should try to edit them properly to the same size, or at least same ratio. -->
    
    <h2>Example Case</h2>
    <p>Let's say we want to upload a 1500px square image, and make it available for retina displays and responsive.</p>
    <p>We could <code>.image {width:100%; /*height:auto; is default*/}</code> for responsiveness. But yet it loses resolution when stretching out or 
    wastes bandwidth when shrinking in. We can add <em>srcset</em> and upload diff sizes for different viewports. </p>
    <!--be careful not altering the aspect ratio of the image -->
	
    <h2>Control Of Backgrounds</h2>

    <p>Backgrounds can be selectively included using media queries.</p>
