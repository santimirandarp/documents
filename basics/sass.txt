Installation

Sass can be used and installed in 3 ways:

1. Visual Studio Code extension (not dart sass, straightforward install)
2. From npm: npm install sass [--global], and used with gulp, npm install gulp-sass
3. Downloading the binaries (from github) and adding sass to the $PATH.
https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.25.0

Dart Sass allows to split using 
@use rule. The css code is pasted into the main file.

Example

at _mixins.scss

@mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}

at main.scss

@use 'mixins'

.box { @include mixins.transform(rotate(30deg)); }

Comments

Single line comments are not compiled into css.
Multiline comments are compiled into the css, not the minified one.

Values inside css functions

If using a variable inside a function like url() or calc() the proper way is 
including the variable as #{$variable} instead of just $variable.


Working with combinators

h2 {color:blue;
  + p {
  color:red;}
}

Compiles to 

h2{color:blue}

h2 + p {color:red}

Crazy Mixins

@mixin define-emoji($name, $glyph) {
  span.emoji-#{$name} {
    font-family: IconFont;
    font-variant: normal;
    font-weight: normal;
    content: $glyph;
  }
}

@include define-emoji("women-holding-hands", "ðŸ‘­");

Variables Example

$base-color: #c6538c;
$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);

.alert {
  border: 1px solid $border-dark;
}
