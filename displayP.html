    <h2>Display</h2>
    <p>Blocks can be thought as boxes. Always start on a new line and extends to the full available width.<br> To center
        a block-element horizontally respect to its parent container add: <code>margin:auto;</code>
        Note: it has no effect if the width is not set (or is set to 100%).</p>
    <p>Inline-blocks don&#39;t start on a new line (as the name indicates) and do not
        extend to the full width but occupy minimum amount required.
        Width and height can be set for inline block elements.
        To center an image set
        <pre>
    <code>.centerImage{margin: auto; display:block;}</code>
</pre> They behave as blocks

        in the sense that either wraps completely or do not wrap at all.</p>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and
        take up as much width as necessary. There are many ways to center a line vertically: line height for one line,
        padding for one or multiple lines, position relative, and so on.
        Only width and line-height can be tweak through css, not height.
        To just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center;</p>
    <p> &lt;img&gt; and &lt;a&gt; are inline elements, but the state can be modified with display property.
    </p>
    <h3 id="more-values-for-display">More values for display</h3>
    <p>Another value for display is none.
        And a similar one is visibility:hidden (but the space remains).</p>
    <h2>Floats</h2>
    <p>As the word says a floated element floats on its parent element.
        We tell this through <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr>
        by using <code>float:right|left|none*|inherit;</code>. As indicated by the
        * <code>float: none;</code> is the default value.
    </p>
    <h3><code>float:right|left;</code>. What happens here?</h3>
