Utils are tools to get info about something.
There are linux utils (systemwise), network utils, etc.

free -h
du -hd 1
dmesg (probably more related to connected devices)
tail /var/log/syslog (dmesg is under /log too)
watch <programm> runs a program every certain amount of time, has some default if not specified.
date tells us the date. 
watch date updates it, & works as a clock.
most of the outputs can be redirected to file as: progrun >> savedata
journalctl (to look for error fly-by output of commands.) Is a systemd tool.
top, htop
ifconfig (network info).
ping (when using server-only, it let us know if internet is working by asking for bites to websites)
ex: ping www.youtube.com (are you there?)
lsblck list the mounted devices (snaps shown too, as they are mounted).
For mounting / unmounting a device use 
sudo mount /dev/[deviceid] mountingPoint
example sudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/ (or /mnt)
sudo umount /dev/sda2 will unmount it.
sudo fdisk -l //list all mounted devices, the id, and a description of the device.
