# IRC and Matrix
Both basically allows us to chat.  

## IRC (thru Quassel)
Quassel is an irc client, i.e a program to set up a server and once we connect to it 
we can type /join channelname or just press the join button, and then adding the channel name.

For example, for distrotube:
1) Click on file, networks, configure networks.
2) Check the channel's server on the web. 
3) Add the server if it's not already there (freenode in this case). 
4) Go to join and add #distrotube. 

The user config file for quassel, as expected,
is ~/.config/quassel-irc.org/quasselclient.conf

## Matrix

Matrix is something new and we need an analogy. IRC, whatsapp, 
sms, facebook msn, in the end are or can be thought as 
servers. A server could be like an isolated container, we can't send 
an sms through whatsapp. 

Matrix allows communication between those containers. For example, 
it's possible to get into an IRC chat.

I'm on this phase, learning how to set that up. 

Matrix allows us to: 
1) Register to a server
2) Host our own server 

1) Known as homeserver. The registration to one of those servers can be done in Riot. 
Riot is powered by Matrix and is a web client (frontend) for Matrix. 
there are many clients other than Riot listed below.
2) To create a server use Synapse.

** Conversations on Matrix can be encrypted and no one but the integrants 
have access to it.** 

### Bridging
It is the connection between platforms.
You can log into freenode, facebook messenger, etc. etc.

### Clients
https://matrix.org/clients/ has a list of clients: web-bases, for phones, 
desktop and terminal based. Once on one, join to #matrix:matrix.org

Also check https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/ there is list of 3: 
one desktop, one terminal, one for phones. Probably good to start there.
