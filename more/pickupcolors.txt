strategies:

Choose colors representative of the context ex red for crime stories, etc.

Choose colors from the main image (if there is a main, big, meaningful image). 

Use a website to expand this ideas.

Do not use too many colors. 

And don't worry about colors and font types till the end of the web.

using hsl and playing with l, or maybe rgba and playing with a might be an easy technique to generate more colors on the same pallette. An advantage of hue is we know the color. A disadvantage is I don't understand s vs l.

watch out for good contrast between text and background.

Use techniques like box-shadow or text shadow to make things look smooth or stand out text.
