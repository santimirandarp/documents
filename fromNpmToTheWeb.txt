Suppose we:
* create a js file to interact with the html.
* import/require many node modules in this .js file. 
* link the file in <script> tags

The browser has no idea what those node modules are, so we need to 
'paste' the code in our .js file. For this we can use browserify or webpack.

1. Install browserify with `npm i browserify`

2. run `npm browserify infile.js outfile.js`

3. Link outfile.js in the script tags and the code will run.
