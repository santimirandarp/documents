Suppose we:
* require many node modules in .js files
* link the file in <script> tags
* compile the page etc.

The problem is the browser has no idea what node modules are, so we need to 
paste the code in our .js file.

For this we can use browserify of webpack, or something else.

Install browserify with `npm i browserify`

And run `npm browserify infile.js outfile.js`

Link outfile.js in the script tags and the code will run.
