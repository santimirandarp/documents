'Break the UI into basic, meaningful parts, and those become your Components.'

MIXING HTML and JS

- We write normal HTML as a return value of functions. 
- Inside the HTML we can write any JS but between  { js here }. 
- Out of the HTML tags we write normal js.


HTML differences
- All attributes are camelcase. className, onClick, etc.
- Self closing elements STRICTLY NEED the closing slash <img />, <br/>, <input/>, <hr/>
- All elements can be self closed: <div/>. This has a specific use case: 
to render a component.

Example:

//from npm
from react import React
from react-dom import ReactDOM;
const insertThis  = "but good"
const JSX = (<div id="myDiv"> <h1 className="reddish"> The little {insertThis} document</h1> </div>)
//JSX is always equal to a wrapper element.
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById("root")) 



RENDERING
//1. runs all js, 
//2. puts the result into the html document.



COMPONENTS
html can be created using variables, functions or  classes. The last 2 are called Components. If created using function is called **stateless functional component**. Other components are **Stateful**. This components are always created using classes, and define this.state = {} in the constructor() of the class.
More on it in STATES.

Components in React start with a capital letter. And they are rendered as 
<Name/> either in ReactDom.render([comp, var],targetElement) or render( ){ }. 

Components can be exported and imported. For example we could export 
<Nav/>, <Header/>, <Article/> and <Footer/> and import them in App.js
Next we create a parent component, containing all the previous components. Finally we use React render to get all done.



RENDER TO THE HTML DOCUMENT
Any HTML in the .html file with an ID can be a target for adding content using React. Example ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))

EXAMPLE OF DOCUMENT USING EXPORT



PROPERTIES

<Name key={value}/>

Name is a component either functional or class. If defined as a function we pass (props){props.key} but if using a class component we use render(){this.props.key} to achieve the same thing. 


STATES

class MyStatefulComponent extends React.Component    
{
constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = { posts:"allpostsHere"}
}
render() {
let JSX=<div><h2>New Posts</h2><ul><li>{this.state.name}</li></ul></div>
return JSX
}
}

Stateless functions and stateless components just do not have this 'state' object.

We can also use const name = this.state.name right before the 'return JSX' and pass {name} in the JSX variable, instead of 
{this.state.name} it's a matter of how readable is the code.
