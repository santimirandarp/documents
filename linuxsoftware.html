    <h2 id="linux-installation-methods">Software Sources</h2>
    
    <p>Software Sources aka Package Repositories, it's the places where linux look at to find programs. In the end, any of them is a web address pointing to the <code>.deb</code> files. There are 3 main software sources (repos etc) depending on the web host.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
                Official </dt>

            <dd>Official repos, default source for <code>sudo apt/aptitude install programName</code>.
                These are found in sources list.</dd>

            <dt>
                Launchpad </dt>

            <dd>Launchpad is <abbr title="Personal Package Archive">PPA</abbr> repos.
                It can be added as an apt source (editing the sources list).
                <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:repoName</code>
                creates the file: <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/repoName</code>
                and contains:
                <code>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/programName disco main</code>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                Own Server with Repos </dt>

            <dd>
                Launchpad is a cheap host. But we might own a server. Then...
                <code>sudo add-apt-repository http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu</code>
                a line is added to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> (the list of software sources):
                <code>deb http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu saucy main</code>
                <p>
                    Taking a close look, PPA is added the same way, just a bit pro because is a trusted source.
                </p>
            </dd>

            <dt> Snap and Ubuntu Make</dt>
                <dd> ... </dd>
            

<dt> Remove and Edit Sources</dt>
<dd>
     <p>Remove using <code>apt remove package_name</code>.</p>
     <p> <code>sources.list</code> can be modified from terminal or 
     from discover -> sources, graphically. Deselect is equivalent to comment out, and they can also be removed.</code>          
            </dd>

        <h2>Package Manager</h2>
        <p>Official, Launchpad and Own repos are <em>program pools</em>. They can mostly be managed with apt, which is
            called
            <em>package manager</em>. Launchpad and Own repos must be added to sources list for updates.
        </p>
        <p>A PM is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and
            removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.</p>

        <p>
            A PM deals with packages: data in archive files. Packages contain metadata: software's name, purpose,
            version number, vendor, checksum, list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon
            installation, metadata is stored in a local package database.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Snap, Gdebi, dpkg, apt, aptitude, are examples for linux packages. They are <strong>not</strong> the same.</li>
            <li> npm is the PM for nodejs. Javascript packages.
            </li>
            <li>
                pip for python
            </li>
            <li>
                none of them have <abbr title="Graphical User Interfaces">GUIs</abbr> but <abbr
                    title="Command Line Interfaces">CLis</abbr> (can be found at muon pm).</li>
        </ul>



        <h3>
            Linux PMs
        </h3>

        <p>
            A new package manager for linux is snap (<code>sudo apt-get install snap</code>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Debian and debian based systems (DBS) use <code>dpkg</code> as a PM (low level). It is the
            mother of all package managers. <code>Apt</code> or its 'twin' <code>aptitude</code> for
            high level. The file extension of the packages is <code>.deb</code>
        </p>
        <h4>
            What do high level package managers offer as different from <code>dpgk</code>?
        </h4>

        <p>
            apt executes <code>dpkg</code> but also look for dependencies and offer us to install them. It's different from gdebi, which is a package installer. Apt offers ways to edit sources lists, upgrade and update the system, autoremove, etc etc.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Linux Package Installers: gdebi and QApt
        </h3>
        Both offer optional GUI besides CLI. <code>.deb</code> file must be on the computer (usually downloaded from
        websites). PIs add info to sources list for updates and care about dependencies (automatically installed).
        There is no guarantee that .deb files will be added to sources.list and updated automatically when runnning 
        <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</code>. This is not the case with launchpad, and the reason 
        why it is usually preferred.

        <!-- apt-get ./foo.deb will make the same than gdebi or QApt :) -->

        <h4>
            Fedora Linux Branch
        </h4>
        rpm instead of dpkg for others non dbs. File extesion .rpm

        <h4>
            From Fedora to Ubuntu
        </h4>

        .rmp files can be converted to .deb files -and reverse- using alien tool.

        <h3>
            Software centers for GUIs and CLIs packages.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Softare centers are graphical interfaces to manage software (sources taken from sources lists).
            Examples are Discover/Synaptic/Ubuntu Software Center, etc.
            There are also graphical interfaces for CLI programs like <abbr title="?">MUON</abbr> in lubuntu.
        </p>

        <p> Nodejs, for example,
            is not in discover but in muon.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What is sources lists?
        </h3>

        <p>
            For DBS updates sources are located in /sources.lists, and that's the files the command looks for to update.
            Might be sources from canonical, or PPAs, etc.
            For installing programms, those read dependencies (located in the head of the .deb package/file) and offer
            to install them too.

        <h3>Example using dpkg and gdebi</h3>
        <p>Install Google Chrome :)</p>
        <p>
            <code>.deb</code> packages can be downloaded manually or using <code>wget</code>, for google chrome (which
            is different from chromium)
            it
            is:
            <pre>
                wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //get the file
                sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb //option 1. || -i for install
                sudo gdebi google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.debc//option 2 w gdebi PI.
                sudo apt-get -f install // Errors? use run this and re-run the dpgk command.
            </pre>

        <h3>
            Install compressed files <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.tar.bz2</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Sometimes it's required to download a <code>.tar.gz</code> and manually
            install it.
            Uncompress the files with some software tool. Go to the directory take a look at <strong>readme</strong> or install.
            Classically, running
        </p>
        <pre>

                ./configure
                make
                sudo make install
            
        </pre>
        should do the job (tar files are different than .deb). (So make is some kind of package installer too.)

	<h2>npm and related</h2>
	<p>npm allows us to install webdev-related programs. 
	Also has an option to initialize the project. 
	In this process we create a packages.json file and 
	every time an plug-in is installed (under node_modules) 
	the file is updated.</p>
	<p>Not all the programs follow the same procedure 
	for installation though. Normally it's just <code>npm install -g program</code> the <code>-g</code> being optional as it allows the program to be run out of this project by running a simple command. In the case of gulp both are necessary <code>npm
		install gulp-cli -g</code> and 
	npm install gulp --save-dev</code>. Afterwards we create the <code>gulpfile.js</code> file.</p>
	<p>In brief, a project that is gonna be managed with npm 
	has to be initialized, and then all dependencies must be installed (reading the installation procedure).</p>

	<h2>Web-related programs</h2>

	<p> First let's list them </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mozilla developer: installed with umake</li>
		<li> VSCode: installed with snap package manager</li>
		<li>lynx, w3m: CLI browser and html viewer. apt install</li>
		<li> Zeal: dwld and access offline docs for programming related stuff.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Where do programs live in linux?</h2?
	<p>There are many package installers now. There is the traditional installers and snap, flatpack, umake.
	We can divide installations in 2 groups according to permissions:</p>
     </p>
	Sudo, cross-user installed programs (binary files) sit on <code>/usr/bin</code> or <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. Also <code>/snap/bin</code> for snap-installed packages. <code>/bin</code> and <code>/sbin</code> are 
the bare bones of linux and programs shouldn't be there. Sudo is needed on those programs exactly for the sake of putting the program and dependencies on the root directory structure. This are global-scoped installations. 
</p>
<p>
User scoped installations 
follow the similar paths <code>~/.local/bin</code>. This installation do not require sudo powers. 
<code>umake</code> installed packages sit on <code>/home/santi/.local/share/umake/bin</code>. </p>
<p> Some programs might ask for adding a the address to the $PATH variable, after putting the binary files somewhere. Of course we can put the binaries on <code>/usr/bin</code> or <code>~/.local/bin</code> and all should be good.
In case we add a new directory, the path to the bin can be set into <code>~.profile</code> or changing <code>/etc/environment
</code>. In any case afterwards <<code>source ~.profile</code> or <code>source /etc/environment
</code> has to be run to activate the changes. If we change <code> /etc/environment</code> it might be necessary to source the 
profile anyways. We can check that typing <code>echo $PATH</code> on the terminal.</p></body>
