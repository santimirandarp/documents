<h1>Transfer data between 2 linux computers (requirement: wi-fi)</h1>
<ul>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>scp (secure copy i.e works the same than cp command)</li>
<li>sftp (CLI or Filezilla common &amp; nice GUI)</li>
<li>sshfs, (like having another system mounted on ours)</li>
<li>nfs, samba, giver</li>
</ul>
<p>First 4 are all ssh-dependent, i.e they work behind the same security principles than ssh.</p>
<p>scp and sshfs follow a very similar syntaxis. &#39;command source destination&#39;</p>
<p>=====================symlinks and aliases==============</p>
<p>Ok, there are errors in both of the above posts. Power users of MacOS X should understand that there are three types of file links available under MacOS X. They are known as hard links, soft links (or symlinks), and aliases. The first two come from Unix/UFS, the second from MacOS/HFS.</p>
<p>A hard link is essentially a second entry in the file system pointing to the same data. If you create a hard link to a file, there is no sense in which one of the links is the &quot;original&quot; file and the other is a link. They are both equivalent. If you edit the data under one name, and then look at the other file, it will be edited as well, because they share the same data. A hard link necessarily must point to a file on the same file system (partition). I believe that some unix systems let you make hard links to directories, but only if you are root, and only under certain circumstances. I don&#39;t know much about this.</p>
<p>A soft link is a seperate file which points to another file via its path. A soft link can exist even if the original file is deleted or moved, but it just points to nothing. Different unix programs (for example &quot;ls&quot;) treat soft links differently. Because it is a seperate file, a program has to distinguish between the pointer and the file itself. For example, if you delete a softlink with &quot;rm&quot; you are deleting the link, not the thing it points to.</p>
<p>An alias is very similar to a soft link, except that it points to a file via its HFS handle. So, if you move or rename a file, the alias still works. If you move it to another file system, however, it doesn&#39;t (I think). While in general this method is more robust than softlinks, it still has its disadvantages. For example, if a program saves a file by writing a new file and then deleting the original, rather than editing the original, then an alias will be broken. I think that most Mac and Unix do this, though, but for different reasons (Mac programs do it so aliases will still work, Unix programs do it so hardlinks will still work).</p>
<p>Under OS X, I think you can <em>only</em> create aliases from the finder. Soft links look like aliases in the finder, but aren&#39;t. I&#39;m pretty sure you can create hard links as well, but the Darwin team had to use some virtual file system trickery to make it work, as HFS doesn&#39;t support it natively (I think). for more info on this, check out:</p>
