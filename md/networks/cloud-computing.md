# Cloud Computing
Accessing a remote machine resources through the internet. Internet is the same as Cloud, it just means remote machine (physical or virtual). When sharing resources through the internet there are common problems, and so there are companies offering solutions. There are: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infraestructure as a Service.

* SaaS: companies offer plain software that we access through the internet. We can access through a web browser or other clients (like thunderbird, Outlook). GMail, and all google apps are examples. Same for microsoft mail and services. Dropbox is another example, FTP clients, etc.
* PaaS: instead of a software, we access a computer. We choose the OS, and comes pre configured. The main player here is AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* IaaS: we access a raw computer, there is next to nothing installed besides the OS. In some sense, we're getting only the "infraestructure" (plus the OS).
