# Cloud Computing
Accessing a remote machine resources through the internet/cloud. When sharing resources through the internet there are common problems, and so there are companies offering solutions. There are: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infraestructure as a Service.

* SaaS: software that we access through the internet. We can access through a *web browser or other clients* (like thunderbird, Outlook, Compass). GMail, AWS, Mongo cloud are examples. Same for microsoft mail and services. Dropbox is another example, FTP clients, etc.
* PaaS: we access a full computer. We choose the OS and comes pre configured. The main player here is AWS (Amazon Web Services, but also google cloud, azure etc.).
* IaaS: we access a raw computer, there is next to nothing installed besides the OS. In some sense, we're getting only the "infraestructure" (plus the OS).
