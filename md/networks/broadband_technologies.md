# Broadband Technologies
Or how do we get the internet!

Broadband and Baseband, inside and outside. Broadband are the huge tentacles of the network, the big cables and infrastructure (satellites, etc); Baseband are just hairs, small wires in our house. Yet they follow similar rules coming from the Ethernet Protocol.

For DSL and Cable the infrastructure is already there. Optic Fibre requires more money to build structure and lay the fiber cable lines down.

* T1 (old)
* Carrier Ethernet
* Point to Point (wireless). An antenna at home connects to a main antenna. 
* Wireless to Wireless. For PtP the antennas must be very well aligned, so we can not change the spot. For WtW this is not necessary.  Sim Card Routers, phones.
* DSL (not shared), it's a phone line connected to the modem. The modem might or not be included on the router. Not as fast as Cable. There is Symmetric SDSL and assymetric (ADSL). Normally users have ADSL where upload/download speed ratio is less than 0.5, SDLS is same speed.
*  Cable (shared). On pick hours it slows down. It plugs the normal Cable (coaxial) on the modem; the ISP is the same company than the cable.
* FIOS fiber optic fastest and unaffected by interfecence as copper electric waves are.
* Satellite (huge latency, speed is ok). Not useful for RTC, Streamings, etc.

## Ethernet?
As far as I understand, all broadband technologies use Ethernet Standards, different from 802.3 which is for LAN.
