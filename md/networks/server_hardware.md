# Server Hardware

Servers use Xeon processors, redundant power supplies (RSP) so if one dies the system keeps running (ideally it runs 24/7). We can take out and replace it. Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). The computer maintains more than one copy of the data, using many hard drives, if one cracks down, we can replace it, and everything is rebuild. Error-code Correction (ECC) RAM runs a check of the RAM.
