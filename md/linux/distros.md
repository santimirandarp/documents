# Distros, flavors and versions

Ubuntu derives from Debian but has its own repos. Arch has its own repos. These are different *distros*.

Ubuntu comes with a GNOME Desktop Environment and some repos in sources list. Mint, Lubuntu, etc uses similar repos but different DE (MATE).  All are different *flavors* of the same distro.

A flavor have many versions. There is usually a LTS version and another one suitable for curious users. LTS ends in .04 (like 19.04, and released in April) and 19.10 is the short term version.

There are also many unofficial distros and flavors.
