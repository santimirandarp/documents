## Example Case: Lubuntu

Lubuntu defaults on an Ubuntu core system, LXQt Desktop Environment
allowing startup apps and its configuration where we can configurate any
manager as window managers, login managers; brightness, appearance,
icons themes, screensaver; also comes with Openbox window manager,
Openbox Menu, Alsa as a sound manager, some Network Manager, etc. etc.
All this can be changed, even the Desktop Environment.

In any distro, for example Ubuntu, we can install the server with
different desktop environments, and also tweak all the previous
managers.

## LXQt Desktop Environment

The desktop environment comes with many applications or programs. Power
management, global keybindings, the runner. All config files for those
apps. And the appearance, brightness.
