# Windows and Linux

## Windows and Linux {#windows-and-linux}

Linux start is on the root directory, instead of C drive. System &
program files are stores in different locations (bin, sbin, lib, usr)
not in one as C:program files. Linux cares about capitalisation. New
users can be created similar to windows, and can\'t access other users
accounts.
