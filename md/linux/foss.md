# foss and floss

The acronym means Free (Libre) and Open Source Software. 

Free is not necessarily free of charge, and Open Source is not enough to be foss. 
Free is the four freedoms detailed below (simplified).

* Read (right)
* Copy (right)
* Modified (right)
* Redistributed under same terms (obligation)

If you choose to redistribute a floss, it has to be Libre, there is no other option. 
This also known as Copyleft.

## Not foss

Not foss software is usually
* Compiled/encypted software,
* Subjected to restrictive Licenses. 

Microsoft Word is an example, we get an encrypted executable file. 
Another related term is a freeware. Freeware might not be foss, again, because of the encryptions.
Freeware that is not floss is dangerous for society.

## License
All we need is written in the Licenses. Basically, licenses are restrictions coming along with the 
software. There are only a few foss-compatible. For example Apache or gpl.

gpl license was created by one of the most important foss-related organizations: GNU. 
This was founded by Richard Stallman in 1983, and they created a set of foss tools, which are 
a big part of Linux. Linux itself should be called GNU/Linux. The kernel was not created by gnu but 
by Linus Torvalds.

## Why floss, and what role does is play in the big scale
floss allows people to read the code of the program they are executing. With popular software most of people are users, but many expert programmers are able to check, improve and alert about security bugs on code. Also, big companies send information about users by writing spyware (parts of the program that only are there to spy on users). Because anyone can access a foss, spyware is almost non existent.

Spywares are very, very common in Apps and big company's software.
