# foss and floss

The acronym means Free (Libre) and Open Source Software. 

Free is not necessarily free of charge, and Open Source is not enough to be foss. 
Free is the four freedoms detailed below (simplified).

* Read (right)
* Copy (right)
* Modified (right)
* Redistributed under same terms (obligation)

If you choose to redistribute a floss, it has to be Libre, there is no other option. This also known as Copyleft.

## Not foss

Not foss software is usually
* Compiled/encypted software,
* Subjected to restrictive Licenses. 

Code we can't read, can easily be misused for restricting our freedom. Freeware isn't always foss, again, because of the encryptions. Freeware that is not floss is dangerous for society.

## License
Licenses are restrictions coming along with the software. There are only a few foss-compatible. For example Apache or gpl.

gpl license was GNU (founder richard stallman, 1983) most are part of Linux. Linux itself should be called GNU/Linux. The kernel was not created by gnu but by Linus Torvalds.

## Why floss, and what role does is play in the big scale
floss allows people to read the code of the program they are executing. Because anyone can access a foss, spyware is almost non existent.

Spywares are very, very common in Apps and big company's software.
