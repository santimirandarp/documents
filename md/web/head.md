# \<head> element

Contains all metadata or data about data. In short, it\'s a standard
description of a website. Contains the encoding format, author,
description, open graph data, twitter data, the favorites\' icon or
*favicon*, links to stylesheet (type attribute is not needed anymore,
but `[href]` and `[rel]` are.), scripts tags with `[src]` attribute.
Script though, is usually found right before the body\'s closing tag.
The main use is link to a javascript file, or contain plain js right on
it.
