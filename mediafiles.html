Embedding content in the web:

* img self closing.
* figure (and/or picture?), audio and video. double tag accepts source attri
butte.
* iframe, canvas. double tag

iframe is used to embed 'big elements' through src='...'
like youtube videos and google maps.
Example:

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d34510.172409980034!2d-5.732528299999999!3d57.275678049999996!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1581131376120!5m2!1sen!2suk" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

From MDN:

'This is great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't want to have to implement your own version of â€” such as video from online video providers, commenting systems like Disqus, maps from online map providers, advertising banners, etc.'

Embedding content or if your content is embedded is quite a serious matter security-wise, so be careful when using.

6  wMedia files can an image, video, audio. Common 'formats' are jpg, png, webm, mp4, mp3, wav.
But are called containers. They define the file structure. Usually all containers 
define the file structure as a set of layers. One layer is metadata, 
then there are channels (as video channel and audio channel in a movie), a text channel. 

Those channels are encoded in some format like H.264 for video and MPEG for audio.

This are called codecs and really speak about how all the raw  data is converted 
to something else, so it's important to have a general idea.

-A  concrete example

webm is a container. Video codec is VP8 or VP9; audio codec is Vorbis or Opus. 
This format is not supported by older browsers and probably older software in general.

-Extra bites

Programs use the metadata to know what format (codec) every channel is in.

-Why do codecs exist instead of just raw media data?

The reason why there are so many codecs for the raw data is -apparently- the filesize.
Media and video files are huge and they need to be compressed. They are many compression algorithms 
and that's why there are many codecs and formats.

-Interesting to see on config

Programs like kazam encode the data-stream using both audio and video codecs!

- SVG 

* Highly scalable (don't pixellate)
* small file size

can be embedded into html using <svg options> </svg> or <img src='path/to/images/svg.svg /'> or an iframe.

Drawing with svg

This is very stimulant for the mind, could be nice to try with a live server. Inkscape allows vector graphics too.
