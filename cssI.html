    <p>HTML5 controls a webpage's <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>semantics</strong>.
    CSS controls how the page <strong>looks</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Syntaxis: <code>selector {css rules}</code>. The <em>selector</em>
	    points to an <abbr title='Hypertext Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> element.
        </p>
   
	<h2 id="how-to-write-css">How to Write CSS</h2>
    <p><u>Syntaxis</u> <pre><code>selector {property: value;}</code></pre></p>
    <p><u>Selectors</u>: .class, #id, tag, attribute value (forms).</p>
    <p><u>Multiple Classes</u>
        <pre><code>&lt;div class= 'className1 className2'&gt; Some Random Text&lt;div&gt;</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h2> Brief</h2>

    <p>Elements come with custom styling (user agent stylesheet), or inherit a property, 
    or can be styled using any selector. Inherited props can be overwritten, assigned props 
    fight with each other and the more specific wins. If specificity is the same, then
     source order defines.</p>


    <h2>Inheritance and Overwriting</h2>

    <p><strong>Some</strong> properties are inherited (passed on from parents to children). An example 
    is color (with the exception of anchors), fonts (with exception of input forms), text-align, background.
    We expect those to be inherited.    
	On the other hand width, margin, border, padding <strong>are not inherited</strong>.</p>
    </p>
    <h3 id="clashes">Clashes</h3>
    
    <p>An elements styling then, can be set on its own (by us or agent's stylesheet)  or inherited.
    If we reassing an inherited property, as we expect, it gets overwritten. 
    </p>
    <pre>
        body{color:black;}

        h1 {color:red;} //overwrittes black
        
        h1 span {color:green;} //overwrittes red
        
        p, h3, h4 {//inherit color from body!} //inherit
    </pre>

    <p>What happens when 2 rules refer to the same HTML element? The algorythm decides which one to apply.
    How?</p>
    <p>Two concepts matter here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specificity: <u>The Rule of 4 places</u></li>
        <li>Source Order (aka Cascade): Last rule defined applies.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>CSS and the Browser</h2>

    <p>    Browsers ignore chunks of code they do not understand either properties-values or blocks (if the selector is
    not understood).
    Dom is different to View Source. The browser may correct errors,
and modify the DOM if js is being applied.
This error correction might be different in diff browsers. So it's a
good idea to validate the code in html and css validator.
    </p>
    <p>
We can select inspect elements (selecting on the page) or in the DOM.
The css rules appear on the right, crossed over rules might mean different things:
overwritten rule, rule not understood by the browser, doesn't exist, etc.</p>
