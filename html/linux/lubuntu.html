  <h2>Example Case: Lubuntu</h2>
  <p>Lubuntu defaults on an Ubuntu core system, LXQt Desktop Environment allowing startup apps and its 
  configuration where we can configurate any manager as window managers, login managers; 
  brightness, appearance, icons themes, screensaver; also comes with  Openbox window manager, 
  Openbox Menu, Alsa as a sound manager, some Network Manager, etc. etc. All this can be 
  changed, even the Desktop Environment.</p>
  <p>In any distro, for example Ubuntu, we can install the server with different 
  desktop environments, and also tweak all the previous managers.</p>
  <h2>LXQt Desktop Environment</h2>
  <p>The desktop environment comes with many applications or programs. Power management, 
  global keybindings, the runner. All config files for those apps. And the appearance, brightness.
