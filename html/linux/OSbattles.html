    <h1>Windows and Linux</h1>
  <h2 id="windows-and-linux">Windows and Linux</h2>
  <p>Linux start is on the root directory, instead of C drive. System &amp; program files are stores in different locations (bin, sbin, lib, usr) not  in one as C:program files. Linux cares about capitalisation. New users can be created similar to windows, and can&#39;t access other users accounts.</p>
